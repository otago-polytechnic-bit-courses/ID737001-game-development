\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will design and develop an application that enables a user to upload and download a game build, i.e., .exe file to and from \textbf{Google Drive}. In addition, marks will be allocated for code quality and best practices, documentation and Git usage.

\section*{Learning Outcome}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design and build secure applications with dynamic database functionality following an appropriate software development methodology.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 21 June 2024} at \textbf{4.59 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} across all assessments in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all application files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/wlzE5yYo}{https://classroom.github.com/a/wlzE5yYo}. If you do not have not one, create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. Create a branch called \textbf{practical}. The latest application files in the \textbf{practical} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}. 

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Extensions will \textbf{only} be granted if you are unable to complete the assessment by the due date because of \textbf{unforeseen circumstances outside your control}. The length of the extension granted will depend on the circumstances and \textbf{must} be negotiated with the course lecturer before the assessment due date. A medical certificate or support letter may be needed. Extensions will not be granted for poor time management or pressure of other assessments.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{ID607001: Introductory Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Instructions}

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcome 1 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{Backend:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Developed using \textbf{Node.js}.	
		\item Can run in development without modification.
		\item Use the \textbf{Google APIs Node.js Client} library to interact with the \textbf{Google Drive API}.
		\item Implement endpoints for uploading and downloading game builds to and from \textbf{Google Drive}.
		\item Ensure proper authentication is implemented using \textbf{OAuth 2.0}. Store the \textbf{client id}, \textbf{client secret}, \textbf{redirect uri} and \textbf{refresh token} in a \textbf{.env} file.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Frontend:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Create an \textbf{HTML} file with a form to upload a game build to \textbf{Google Drive}. Ensure proper security measures are in place, i.e., validating the file type and size.
		\item Display a list of game builds stored in \textbf{Google Drive} in a \textbf{HTML} table. The table should include the game build's name, size and a download button.
		\item UI is visually attractive with a coherent graphical theme and style.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Quality and Best Practices - Learning Outcome 1 (45\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{Node.js} \textbf{.gitignore} file is used.
	\item Environment variables' key is stored in the \textbf{.env.example} file. 
  	\item Appropriate naming of files, variables, functions and resource groups.
  	\begin{itemize}
	\item Resource groups are named with a plural noun instead of a noun or verb, i.e., \textbf{/api/items} not \textbf{/api/item}.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Idiomatic use of control flow, data structures and in-built functions.
  \item Efficient algorithmic approach.
  \item Sufficient modularity.
  \item Code is formatted.
  \item No dead or unused code. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Documentation and Git Usage - Learning Outcome 1 (5\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{GitHub} project board or issues to help you organise and prioritise your development work. The course lecturer needs to see consistent use of the \textbf{GitHub} project board or issues for the duration of the assessment.
    \item Provide the following in your repository \textbf{README.md} file:
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item How do you setup the environment, i.e., after the repository is cloned?
	  \item How do you run your application locally?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use of \textbf{Markdown}, i.e., headings, bold text, code blocks, etc.
    \item Correct spelling and grammar.
    \item Your \textbf{Git commit messages} should:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reflect the context of each functional requirement change.
      \item Be formatted using an appropriate naming convention style.
    \end{itemize}	
\end{itemize} 

\subsection*{Additional Information}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You need to show the course lecturer the initial \textbf{GitHub} project board before you start your development work. Following this, you need to show the course lecturer your \textbf{GitHub} project board at the end of each week.
    \item \textbf{Do not} rewrite your \textbf{Git} history. It is important that the course lecturer can see how you worked on your assessment over time. 
\end{itemize}
