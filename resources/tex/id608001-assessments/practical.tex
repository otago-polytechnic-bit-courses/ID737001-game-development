\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} or \textbf{group} assessment, you will develop a \textbf{RESTful API} using \textbf{Express}, \textbf{Node.js} and the \textbf{OpenTDB API}, and deploy it as a \textbf{web service} on \textbf{Render}. Your data will be stored in a \textbf{PostgreSQL} database on \textbf{Render}. Also, you will develop \textbf{frontend applications} using \textbf{React} and \textbf{Vite}. These applications will consume the \textbf{RESTful API} mentioned above. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build \textbf{full-stack applications}, but rather to demonstrate an ability to decouple your \textbf{RESTful API} from your \textbf{frontend applications}. In addition, marks will be allocated for code quality and best practices, documentation and \textbf{Git} usage.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Apply design patterns and programming principles using software development best practices.
	\item Design and implement full-stack applications using industry relevant programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Instructions}

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1 and 2 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{RESTful API:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Note:} You are required to use the provided \textbf{schema.prisma} file. You can find this in the \textbf{assessments} directory of the \textbf{course materials} repository.
		\item \textbf{User:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item You will have \textbf{two} types of users - \textbf{admin} and \textbf{basic} user.
			\item An \textbf{admin} and \textbf{basic} user will have the following information: first name, last name, username, email address, profile picture, password, confirm password and role. The confirm password does not need to be stored in the database. The users' profile picture will be from the following \textbf{API} - \\ \href{https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api}{https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api}. Each profile picture should be, in most cases, different. I suggest using a random seed when setting the user's profile picture.
			\item An \textbf{admin} and \textbf{basic} user can login, get their information and update their information but not delete themselves. An \textbf{admin} user can get all users' information, update all \textbf{basic} users' information but not \textbf{admin} user's information and delete all \textbf{basic} users but not \textbf{admin} users. A \textbf{basic} user can register.
			\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for registering a \textbf{basic} user, the following error checking needs to be implemented using \textbf{Joi} and/or conditional statements:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item First name has a minimum length of two characters, a maximum length of 50 characters and alpha characters only.
				\item Last name has the same error checking as first name above.
				\item Username is unique, has a minimum length of five characters, maximum length of ten characters and alphanumeric characters only, i.e., johndoe123.
				\item Email address is unique, contains the username above, an @ special character and a second-level domain, i.e., johndoe123@email.com.
				\item Password has a minimum length of eight characters, maximum length of 16 characters and contains one numeric character and one special character.
				\item Confirm password is the same as the password above. \textbf{Note:} Confirm password will not be a field in the \textbf{User} table. Rather, it will be used to validate the user's password.
			\end{itemize}
			For each error check, a status code and response message is returned, i.e., "First name must have a minimum length of two characters".
			\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for logging in a user using either username/password or email address/password, return a status code, a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully logged in" and the user's \textbf{JWT}.
			\item When performing a \textbf{PUT} and \textbf{DELETE} request, return a status code and a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$'s information has successfully updated" or "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully deleted".
			\item Five \textbf{admin} users are seeded via a \textbf{script} in the \textbf{package.json} file. The \textbf{admin} users' data will be fetched from a local file and inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}.  
			\item Five \textbf{basic} users are seeded via an \textbf{admin} user. The \textbf{basic} users' data will be fetched from a private \textbf{GitHub Gist} using \textbf{Axios} and inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}. 
		\end{itemize} 
		\item \textbf{Quiz:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each quiz will have the following information: name, start date, end date, category, difficulty, type, number of questions, list of questions, list of correct answers, list of incorrect answers, list of scores and average score. The category, list of questions, list of correct answers and list of incorrect answers will be fetched from the following \textbf{API} - \href{https://opentdb.com/api\_config.php}{https://opentdb.com/api\_config.php}. The difficulties will be easy, medium and hard. The types will be multiple choice or true/false.
			An \textbf{admin} user can create and delete a quiz. A \textbf{basic} user can participate in a quiz only once. An \textbf{admin}, \textbf{basic} and \textbf{unauthenticated} user can get all quizzes, get all past quizzes, get all present quizzes and get all future quizzes, get a list of scores for a quiz and average score for a quiz.
			\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for creating a quiz, the following error checking needs to be implemented using \textbf{Joi} and/or conditional statements:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Name has a minimum length of five characters, a maximum length of 30 characters and alpha characters only.
				\item Start date has to be greater than or equal to today's date.
				\item End date has to be greater than the start date and no longer than five days.
