\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 21 June 2024} at \textbf{4.59 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID608001: Intermediate Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome(s) for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic | Te Pūkenga} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all application files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/wlzE5yYo}{https://classroom.github.com/a/wlzE5yYo}. If you do not have not one, create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest application files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Extensions will \textbf{only} be granted if you are unable to complete the assessment by the due date because of \textbf{unforeseen circumstances outside your control}. The length of the extension granted will depend on the circumstances and \textbf{must} be negotiated with the course lecturer before the assessment due date. A medical certificate or support letter may be needed. Extensions will not be granted for poor time management or pressure of other assessments.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID608001: Intermediate Application Development Concepts}.

\section*{Instructions}

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1 and 2 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize} 

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Quality and Best Practices - Learning Outcome 1 (45\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{Node.js} \textbf{.gitignore} file is used.
	\item Environment variables' key is stored in the \textbf{.env.example} file. 
  	\item Appropriate naming of files, variables, functions and resource groups.
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Resource groups are named with a plural noun instead of a noun or verb, i.e., \textbf{/api/v1/items} not \textbf{/api/v1/item}.
  \end{itemize}
	\item Idiomatic use of control flow, data structures, in-built functions, data fetching and state management design patterns.
  \item Efficient algorithmic approach.
  \item Sufficient modularity.
  \item Each \textbf{controller}, \textbf{route} and \textbf{component} file has a \textbf{JSDoc} header comment located at the top of the file.
  \item Code is formatted using \textbf{Prettier}.
  \item Code is linted using \textbf{ESLint}.
  \item \textbf{Prettier}, \textbf{ESLint} and \textbf{Cypress} are installed as a \textbf{development dependency}.	
\item No dead or unused code. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Git Usage - Learning Outcomes 1 (5\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{GitHub} project board or issues to help you organise and prioritise your development work. The course lecturer needs to see consistent use of the \textbf{GitHub} project board or issues for the duration of the assessment.
	\item Provide the following in your repository \textbf{README.md} file:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A URL to your \textbf{RESTful API} as a \textbf{web service} on \textbf{Render}.
		\item A URL to your published \textbf{RESTful API} documentation. Each route needs to be documented. Include a description, example request and example response.
		\item How do you setup the environments, i.e., after the repository is cloned?
		\item How do you run your \textbf{RESTful API} and \textbf{frontend applications} locally?
		\item How do you run your \textbf{End-to-end tests}?
		\item How do you create and apply a migration?  
		\item How do you reset your database?
		\item How do you seed \textbf{admin} users?
		\item How do you open \textbf{Prisma Studio}?
		\item How do you format your code?
		\item How do you lint your code?		
	\end{itemize}
    \item Use of \textbf{Markdown}, i.e., headings, bold text, code blocks, etc.
    \item Correct spelling and grammar.
    \item Your \textbf{Git commit messages} should:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reflect the context of each functional requirement change.
      \item Be formatted using an appropriate naming convention style.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Information}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Do not} rewrite your \textbf{Git} history. It is important that the course lecturer can see how you worked on your assessment over time. 
    \item You need to show the course lecturer the initial \textbf{GitHub} project board before you start your development work. Following this, you need to show the course lecturer your \textbf{GitHub} project board at the end of each week.
\end{itemize}
