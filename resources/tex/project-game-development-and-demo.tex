\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 21 June 2024} at \textbf{4.59 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID737001: Game Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome(s) for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all application files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/dbrTesMQ}{https://classroom.github.com/a/dbrTesMQ}. If you do not have not one, create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Unity.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Unity.gitignore}. The latest application files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. Extensions will \textbf{only} be granted if you are unable to complete the assessment by the due date because of \textbf{unforeseen circumstances outside your control}. The length of the extension granted will depend on the circumstances and \textbf{must} be negotiated with the course lecturer before the assessment due date. A medical certificate or support letter may be needed. Extensions will not be granted for poor time management or pressure of other assessments.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID737001: Game Development}.

\section*{Instructions}
\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcome 1 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Code Quality and Best Practices - Learning Outcome 1 (45\%)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{Unity} \textbf{.gitignore} file is used. 
    \item Appropriate naming of files, variables, methods and classes.
    \item Idiomatic use of values, control flow, data structures and in-built functions.
    \item Efficient algorithmic approach.
    \item Sufficient modularity.
    \item Each file has an \textbf{XML documentation comment} located at the top of the file. In the \textbf{root} directory of the \textbf{course materials} repository, you will find an \textbf{XML documentation comment} example in the \textbf{xml-documentation-comment.txt} file.
    \item Formatted code.
    \item No dead or unused code.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection*{Documentation - Learning Outcome 1 (5\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{GitHub} project board to help you organise and prioritise your development work. The course lecturer needs to see consistent use of the \textbf{GitHub} project board for the duration of the assessment.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection*{Additional Information}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Do not} rewrite your \textbf{Git} history. It is important that the course lecturer can see how you worked on your assessment over time. 
    \item You need to show the course lecturer the initial \textbf{GitHub} project board before you start your development work. Following this, you need to show the course lecturer your \textbf{GitHub} project board at the end of each week.
\end{itemize}
